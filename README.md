## üí° Inspiration

As language learners ourselves, we noticed a fundamental problem: traditional vocabulary learning is disconnected from real-world usage. You study flashcards for hours, only to forget words when you actually need them. We wanted to bridge that gap.

The name "Situ" comes from the Latin phrase "in situ," meaning "in the natural or original position." It reflects our core philosophy: **the best way to learn vocabulary is in context, at the moment you encounter it naturally.**

We were inspired by how children learn languages‚Äîthrough constant exposure and usage in meaningful contexts, not through memorization drills. Situ brings that natural learning process to adult language learners navigating the web.

## üéØ What It Does

Situ creates an immersive vocabulary learning environment within your browser:

1. **Passive Learning Through Reading**: As you browse your favorite websites, Situ automatically highlights your target vocabulary words. You see them in real contexts‚Äînews articles, blog posts, social media. Each encounter reinforces your memory without any effort on your part.

2. **Active Learning Through Writing**: When you compose emails, write comments, or post on social media, Situ suggests ways to incorporate your vocabulary words naturally. This transforms passive knowledge into active usage.

3. **AI-Enhanced Vocabulary Building**: Found an interesting word on a webpage? Right-click and add it to your vocabulary. Situ uses Chrome's built-in AI to instantly generate definitions, usage examples, and synonyms‚Äîall without internet connectivity.

4. **Context Preservation**: Unlike traditional flashcards that strip words of context, Situ's "Recently Seen" feature captures the actual sentences where you encountered each word. Click any word in your dashboard to see where you found it on the web, complete with links back to the original pages.

5. **Progress Tracking & Motivation**: Watch your vocabulary exposure grow with daily statistics, weekly charts, and achievement tracking. Set daily encounter goals to maintain consistency.

6. **Flexible Practice**: When you have a few minutes, use the flashcard system or writing challenges to actively review your vocabulary.

## üõ†Ô∏è How We Built It

**Technology Stack:**
- **Manifest V3**: Built on Chrome's latest extension standard for enhanced security and performance
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**: No frameworks‚Äîpure, optimized code for fast performance
- **Chrome Storage Sync API**: Seamlessly synchronizes vocabulary across all your Chrome devices
- **Chrome LanguageModel API (Gemini Nano)**: Leverages Chrome's built-in on-device AI for privacy-focused intelligent features
- **Content Scripts**: Seamlessly integrates with any webpage for highlighting and writing assistance
- **MutationObserver API**: Intelligently detects dynamic content changes for real-time highlighting
- **Service Workers**: Efficient background processing for context menus and messaging

**Architecture Highlights:**
- **Modular Design**: Separated concerns across background scripts, content scripts, popup, and dashboard
- **Performance Optimization**: Batched statistics updates to prevent Chrome storage quota issues
- **Efficient Text Processing**: Advanced TreeWalker and regex-based highlighting that works on complex web pages
- **Debounced Operations**: Smart throttling prevents excessive processing on dynamic websites
- **Semantic HTML & ARIA**: Accessibility-first design from the ground up

**Development Process:**
1. Started with core reading mode functionality and text highlighting engine
2. Built AI integration layer for offline word enrichment
3. Added writing mode with contextual suggestions
4. Implemented comprehensive statistics and progress tracking
5. Created the Recently Seen feature to capture learning context
6. Developed interactive practice modes for active review
7. Polished UI/UX with extensive user testing and refinement

## üöß Challenges We Ran Into

**1. Chrome Storage Quota Limitations**
Chrome's sync storage has strict quota limits (100KB total, limited write operations). With users potentially encountering dozens of words per browsing session, we quickly hit quota errors.

**Solution**: Implemented a sophisticated batching system that groups statistics updates and flushes them periodically, dramatically reducing write operations while maintaining data accuracy.

**2. Highlighting on Dynamic Websites**
Modern websites (especially single-page applications) constantly modify their DOM. Our initial highlighting approach would miss new content or create performance issues.

**Solution**: Built a MutationObserver-based system with intelligent debouncing that monitors page changes and re-highlights only when necessary, avoiding infinite loops and performance degradation.

**3. Avoiding Infinite Highlighting Loops**
Our highlighting creates new DOM elements (spans). If not careful, the MutationObserver would detect these as new content and try to re-highlight them, causing crashes.

**Solution**: Implemented a filtering system that checks for `situ-` prefixed class names and skips all Situ UI elements during the highlighting traversal.

**4. Preserving Context for Learning**
Initially, we only stored word definitions. User testing revealed that learners wanted to remember *where* they encountered words‚Äîthe actual context matters for memory formation.

**Solution**: Developed the "Recently Seen" feature that extracts the surrounding sentence when a word is highlighted and stores it with a link to the source URL, creating a rich context history.

**5. Writing Mode Integration Complexity**
Different websites implement text inputs differently (textarea vs. contenteditable vs. custom inputs). Making writing suggestions work universally was challenging.

**Solution**: Created an adaptive attachment system that detects multiple types of text fields and positions suggestion buttons dynamically using getBoundingClientRect calculations.

**6. AI Model Availability**
Chrome's LanguageModel API is experimental and requires specific Chrome versions and flags. Handling cases where AI is unavailable proved tricky.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive AI availability checks with graceful fallbacks and helpful error messages guiding users to enable the required Chrome features.

## üèÜ Accomplishments That We're Proud Of

**1. True Offline AI Processing**
We're proud to be one of the first extensions to leverage Chrome's built-in Gemini Nano for 100% offline, privacy-first AI features. Users can enrich vocabulary with zero latency and zero privacy concerns.

**2. Context-Aware Learning**
The "Recently Seen" feature represents a breakthrough in vocabulary learning design. By preserving not just definitions but actual usage contexts with source links, we've created a learning tool that mirrors how humans naturally acquire language.

**3. Performance on Complex Websites**
Our highlighting engine works flawlessly on everything from simple blogs to complex web applications (Gmail, Twitter, Reddit). The TreeWalker-based algorithm with smart filtering handles edge cases gracefully.

**4. Seamless User Experience**
Despite complex functionality under the hood, the user experience is incredibly simple: install, add words, browse as normal. Learning happens automatically without disrupting your workflow.

**5. Comprehensive Feature Set**
We built a complete vocabulary learning ecosystem‚Äînot just highlighting, but AI enrichment, writing assistance, multiple practice modes, statistics tracking, and more. It's a standalone learning platform.

**6. Accessibility Commitment**
Every feature includes ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and semantic HTML. We're proud that Situ is usable by learners with diverse accessibility needs.

**7. Open Source & Educational**
We've documented our code extensively and made it open source, helping other developers learn Chrome extension development and AI integration techniques.

## üìö What We Learned

**Technical Insights:**
- **Chrome Storage is Tricky**: Understanding quota limits, sync vs. local storage, and write operation costs was crucial. Batching and debouncing are essential patterns.
- **Content Script Performance Matters**: Operations that run on every page load must be highly optimized. We learned to profile extensively and minimize DOM traversals.
- **The Power of On-Device AI**: Chrome's LanguageModel API is incredibly powerful. We learned prompt engineering techniques specific to Gemini Nano for optimal definition and example generation.
- **MutationObserver Nuances**: Learned to use sophisticated filtering and disconnection strategies to avoid performance issues on dynamic sites.

**UX/Design Lessons:**
- **Context is King for Learning**: User testing confirmed that preserving the original context where words are encountered is critical for memory retention.
- **Subtlety Matters**: Early versions had overly aggressive highlighting that users found distracting. We learned to balance visibility with subtlety.
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Not all features should be immediately visible. The popup provides quick access, while the dashboard houses advanced features.

**Language Learning Pedagogy:**
- **Spaced Repetition Through Natural Exposure**: Seeing words repeatedly in different contexts (natural spaced repetition) is more effective than scheduled flashcard reviews.
- **Active vs. Passive Vocabulary**: Tracking both "seen" and "used" metrics helped us understand the gap between recognition and production in language learning.
- **Motivation Through Progress**: Visible statistics and goal-setting significantly increased user engagement.

**Development Process:**
- **Iterate Based on Real Usage**: User testing revealed use cases we never anticipated (like wanting to see source URLs for recently seen contexts).
- **Start Simple, Add Complexity**: We started with just highlighting, then added features incrementally based on user needs.
- **Document as You Build**: Writing clear code comments and documentation early saved countless hours during feature additions.
